# Build

To run the webpack dev server, which builds all the files and serves
them from memory, run:

```
make run
```

Then navigate to localhost:8000. The build will be recompiled and your
browser will refresh whenever you modify a source file.

To build files for production, run:

```
make build
```

To lint, run:

```
make lint
```
